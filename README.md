# Elastic-Fiber-Networks
This repository contains the codes to generate a disordered triangular network with active internal force dipoles embedded in it. This can be used to model biological fiber networks such as the acto-myosin networks and the cell-in-ECM networks. The rights to the code belong to Abhinav Kumar, Dr. David Quint and Dr. Kinjal Dasbiswas.
