# Elastic-Fiber-Networks
This repository contains the codes to generate a disordered triangular network with active internal force dipoles embedded in it. This can be used to model biological fiber networks such as the acto-myosin networks and the cell-in-ECM networks. This code was first written by Dr. David Quint during his PhD to study shear behavior of actin networks. In its current form, it has been adapted to simulate active internal forces. The rights to the code belong to Abhinav Kumar, Dr. David Quint and Dr. Kinjal Dasbiswas.
